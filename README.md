# Bootstrap
For this website, Bootstrap framework has been used. Also, the pages were divided into separate parts (header, navigation, footer) and combined via php. On the art_styles.php page, Lightbox JavaScript library has been used for a slideshow. For contact form validation Iâ€™ve used jQuery plugin. In .htaccess file  expiration for files cache and filter for file compression has been set. I optimized website performance using analysis of PageSpeed Tools.
